\question Two resistors --r1-- $\Omega$ and --r2-- $\Omega$ are in parallel. This combination is in turn connected in series with another resistance of value --r3-- $\Omega$. Further this entire combination is connected in parallel to another resistance of --r4-- $\Omega$. Find the effective resistance of the above circuit.
